#textdomain wesnoth-Dreams_of_Urduk
#INTRODUCTION
#Rasduk and Urduk are twin brothers, the only two still alive from their mother Alfa's first litter. Rasduk is a fighter and leader by nature, and he has chosen the path of the hunter; Urduk has mystical tendencies, and is in training as a sparker. The village they live in has become sedentary; they have built wooden houses and try to farm the land in addition to hunting and gathering. Work had begun on a stone building that would serve as the matriarchal dwelling-place.
#
#Rasduk and Urduk's lives were uneventful and unimportant until Urduk began having dreams, dreams prophesying danger for the village. Some new threat was coming that would destroy them all unless they left their wooden houses and once again became wanderers. Rasduk trusted Urduk, and together they went to Sord, the village leader, and told him Urduk's dream. But they were not believed.
#
#1. Away from the Village (649 SF, August)
#Rasduk and Urduk then went to Garan, a friend of Rasduk, a warrior, and convinced him to help them. They gathered as large a group as they could of those willing to leave the village and set off, taking much of the village's food and weaponry. Sord sent a party of warriors after them to recover what they took, but the followers of Urduk were able to slip away into the wilderness before they were caught. The warriors from the village were not willing to chase them there, for in the wilderness, monsters lurked.
