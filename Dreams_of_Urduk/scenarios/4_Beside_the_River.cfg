#4. Beside the River (650 SF, March)
#After wintering in the southern lands, Rasduk brought the nomads back north to the steppes. As they were crossing the great southern river of the steppes, a group of rebels in the tribe, led by Aro of Essa, brother of the slain Koro, rose up to kill "Rasduk the Usurper", pinning him against the river and threatening to throw him in. Many stayed with Rasduk, however, for he had proven himself in the fiery swamps. Crucially, Soma stayed with her mate, as did all those who had come to the nomads from the old village. They were able to put down the rebellion, Aro was killed, and Soma's matriarchy was firmly established, with Rasduk as chieftain.
