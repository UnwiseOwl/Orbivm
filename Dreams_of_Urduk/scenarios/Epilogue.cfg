#EPILOGUE (662 SF/1 SH, January)
#Rasduk and Soma continued as leaders of their nomadic tribe for many years. One winter, they wandered eastwards, went through a mountain pass and a sparse forest, and came to a south-flowing river. They followed it to the ocean, and there encountered what they had never before seen - beasts who were not menn, as Rasduk knew the term, but nevertheless walked upright, wore clothes, and spoke; the latter two they did better than any menn Rasduk had ever seen. These newcomers were, of course, men, though no member of the tribe knew that word. Baffled, they decided against confronting the invaders, and led their nomadic tribe away. Rasduk never saw the men again, dying peacefully at around the age of fifty.
