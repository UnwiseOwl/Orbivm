Version 0.4+ (You? - Future plans)
    ** Make multiplayer campaign ala LoW
    ** Balance and difficulty level sanity checking
    ** Make the maps smaller
    ** Fix recruits so that Samnites and Gravites have different recruit lists
    ** Find a way to get the Khampsa in there (maybe in the desert interaction somehow?)
    ** Add 3a into the campaign generally, skipping it if Brotus lives is silly
    ** Consider making the enemies in 3a Arendians, then the cavalry that chases in the desert into Arendians too?
    ** Improve story and lore interactions
    ** Think about removing the dragon from S6, we already have an Orcs/Dragon fight in the Wild Era
    ** Make the guard interaction in S4 more interesting

        * Lavinians get a larger starting castle
        * Late-arriving Lavinians get castles, more gold and some extra cavalry
    * S4: End of the Paved Road
