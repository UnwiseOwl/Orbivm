#3.5. A Detour (~700 SI, August)
#Unsure of where to go, Sparxus follows the Lavinian Highway heading north-north-west until he reaches a small town which he and the other orcs attack in hopes of finding a map or some sort of directions to the orcish lands. After capturing the town they ends up finding a map, which the Lavinians make many of, in the office of the local magistrate, and they  are on their way again, taking the road that goes due west.
