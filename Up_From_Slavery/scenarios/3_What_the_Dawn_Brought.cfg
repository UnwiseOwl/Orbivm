#3. What the Dawn Brought (~700 SI, August)
#The Lavinians swiftly recover, and, unwilling to lose so many valuable slaves or set a precedent of letting escapees go their way unhindered, they send out Nemidian scouts to hunt Sparxus down. There is a group of forested hills to the northwest of Lavinium, which Sparxus and Grarivus decide to head towards, hoping to get the Nemidians on unfriendly terrain and then ambush them.
