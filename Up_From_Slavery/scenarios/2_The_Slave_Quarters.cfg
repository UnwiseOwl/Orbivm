#SCENARIO 2: The Slave Quarters (~700 SI, August)
#After the 'victorious' day at the Coliseum, Sparxus and the other gladiatores are returned to the slave quarters. Sparxus - who is both more intelligent than the average orc and rather popular - makes a speech to the orcs about how they cannot continue living like this, and how they need to escape and return to their ancestral lands (or really any lands they can get that aren't in the grasp of the oppressive Lavinian Empire). There they can fight when they wish, not at predetermined times, and with whom they wish, not with randomly chosen opponents who they might not want to kill.
#
#Many of the orcs agree with Sparxus, including Grarivus, who commands a large following himself, and who makes a pact with Sparxus to not fight until they have finished their escape - at which point they will, presumably, duel to the death. That night they rush the city wall, kill the guards and head off into the darkness.
