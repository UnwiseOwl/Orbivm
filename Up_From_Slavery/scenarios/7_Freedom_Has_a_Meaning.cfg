#SCENARIO 7: Freedom Has a Meaning (~700 SI, November)
#Sparxus and Grarivus has successfully brought their people out of the Lavinian slave pens are to the home of their ancestors. Now they will fulfil their pact. They are set to duel a month after arriving in the western slopes of the mountains, and, in true gladiatorial style, they will not go one versus one, but will take have groups of several warriors on each side. A makeshift coliseum is made in a steep valley, and the duel commences. The winner will be undisputed lord of the Chainbreaker clan - in the half-remembered words of the old language, their Khan.
#
#This is, after all, what the orcs wanted when they began their escape - not freedom from fighting, but the freedom to fight who and how they wanted.
