    description= _ "the wiry Sprinters have grown enough to run at truly impressive speeds. The warriors of the tribe mockingly say that they need all the speed they can get; they still cannot best a green stabber in single combat, and will never be able to, no matter how much they train. Still, their speed serves the tribe well, and they have often saved these very warriors who mocked them from death, flashing in from across the battlefield and slaying a monster before it can finish off its prey."
