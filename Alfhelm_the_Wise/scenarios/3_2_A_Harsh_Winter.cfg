#PART 3: THE DARK DEPTHS OF THE FOREST
#SCENARIO 2: A Harsh Winter (951 SI, February)
#The residents of the city (being Wylfings) are hesitant to help you, but they are willing to say (somewhat too happily) that Ranhilde and Harn have already passed east into the forested lands. Unfortunately, before you can depart and follow them, a cold winter falls, harsher than any in memory - great Ice Bears from the north even dare to come and haunt the land. You are holed in, unable to leave the city.
