#PART 2: WE MARCH AGAINST THE RED AND GOLD
#SCENARIO 2: South Across the Plains (943 SI, September)
#	As you go south and you pass through Arendia, you encounter a semi-fortified village. You attack it, on the seeress's advice, because you need to learn how to capture fortified towns. Lavinia has many of them, not least among them Lavinium. Before attacking it, however, you receive word of a Sidhe attack on your people. You must decide whether to press on or go back; with difficulty, the seeress convinces you to continue, although you do send some of your army back north to defend the forests.
