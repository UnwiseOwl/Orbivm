#PART 3: THE DARK DEPTHS OF THE FOREST
#SCENARIO 4t: It Doesn't Matter Anyway (952 SI, March)
#	You finally catch up to Harn and Ranhilde. It turns out, they spend the winter in the old plantations on the border of Silvia and the Western March of the Sidhe lands. They have just attacked the Elves in an attempt to kill Vaniyera, who is heading the attacks against the Marauder lands. If they had succeeded, the attacks would have ceased, but as it is, Ranhilde has just been mortally wounded in combat. You come upon them at night, in a lull in the battle. You have a short opportunity to talk to Ranhilde, then she is dead. After she dies, you leave the camp to prepare yourself for the duel with Vaniyera that is to come, knowing you will lose, since the Dwarves have not delivered on their promise. Then, a dwarf messenger appears with the blade, gives it to you, and disappears. The sword is named Stormbreaker.
