#PART 1: TO GO TO WAR
#SCENARIO 4t: Berdssenhold (939 SI, October)
#	Erda Berdssen, the last remaining Berdling after the death of his brother Ard (at his, and your, hands), invites you into Berdlinghold for a council, to decide whether he will join with you. He threatens to slay you for the death of his brother (whom he also killed), but in the end he agrees to aid you in your quest.
