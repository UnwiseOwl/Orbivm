#PART 1: TO GO TO WAR
#PROLOGUE
#	You are Alfhelm, son of a great Marauder thain. But your life has not been easy. You were born in 1203 YH, and seven years later your father led the Marauders to victory in the Battle of Arendia. Lavinia's might was crushed. But you were left at home, a mere child, and when a Sidhe raid struck your village, your family was killed, and your village was forced our of its native forests, into the western mountains. Your father died in the great Battle of Arendia, and this, combined with your own misfortune, prevented you from taking your rightful place as prince of the Marauders. Instead, you grew up in a small village, with no authority among the clans, prey for the larger Marauder bands. Many of the clans had, after the Sidhe attacks, went south to wreak havoc in Lavinia, but yours was not large enough, and you remained in the foothills of the mountains.

#SCENARIO 1: The Seeress (938 SI, December)
#	Then, one winter night, you have a dream. You are not versed in prophecy - you must bring your dream to the Seeress of the village, and ask her advice. However, before you may begin your journey to the seeress's house, an orcish band attacked. You, as a warrior in the village, begin to organize the defense. The seeress, who lives further up the mountain than anyone else, must be warned and brought back to the village, and then you must defend the village until the orcs retreat.
