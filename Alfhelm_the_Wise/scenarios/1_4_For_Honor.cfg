#PART 1: TO GO TO WAR
#SCENARIO 4: For Honor (939 SI, September)
#	The village you conquered has joined with you, and more, you hope, will follow. You have already established for yourself a small kingdom. You lead your army in a vaguely north-east direction, towards the heart of marauderdom, and any villages you encounter as you do so you force to join you. All of the villages you have attacked so far have been weak marauder clans, like yours, but soon, you find yourself attacking the stronghold of the Berdlings, your lord, one of the three Royal Houses, and a true tribe of IE_Marauder_Warriors. They, of course, refuse to join you, and in fact they order your to join them. You order an attack, but before it can happen a group of Sidhe raiders attacks. Some of the other Marauder tribe allies with you in defeating the Sidhe, but some of it attacks you anyway. The Sidhe and the rebel Marauders must be defeated.

        #uo2020: we can do this now by using multiplde teamids for side 3, I should get around to doing it if and when I rebalance this campaigh.
