#PART 3: THE DARK DEPTHS OF THE FOREST
#You have defeated the Lavinians, and, after sacking Lavinium for several days, the Marauder host (well, most of it; many stay behind and rule over the locals) begins making its way back to its homeland. You're return to Marauderdom should have been triumphant, but it is not. It comes out that Ranhilde and Harn arrived back in the Seat of Three Kings several months ago to find that the Sidhe had been attacking. They defended the lands for a while, and eventually led an army east to fight the Sidhe, but it was widely believed it would be defeated. You rush back to battle, with those of your army who are willing to follow you.

#SCENARIO 0t: The Well (951 SI, November)
#	Coming through the pass of Arendia back to Marauder lands, you encounter a mounted messenger rushing south to give you news of the Sidhe attacks. You begin to rush north to protect your homeland. As you enter the narrowest point in the Pass, you consider that it is a particular thunderblade - Vaniyera - who is targetting your house (he has a vendetta against the Alflings), and you also remember stories of the Cave-folk (Dwarves), who might possibly have a sword that could defeat Vaniyera in battle. You go to the Well (deep wells that go down to the realms of the dwarves are how surface-dwellers communicate with them) that sits on the eastern side of the Pass of Arendia (near the lake), summon the dwarves, and tell them of your desire. They promise you just such a blade before you face Vaniyera.
