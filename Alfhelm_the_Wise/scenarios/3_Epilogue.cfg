#EPILOGUE: I Will Not Fall Upon My Blade (952 SI, June)
#You have led a life of great deeds, but also of great failures. You failed to get the Frost Elves to help you against Lavinia, or even to agree to defend Marauderdom when you were gone, and thus brought on the Sidhe invasions. You took the city of Lavinium, but only after five years wasted. Most importantly, you allowed your wife to die in battle against the Marauders because of your own weakness.
#The great deeds of your life are clearly behind you. The Marauder people, always fickle, no longer want you as king - not without Ranhilde as queen. The alliance seems doomed to fracture, as there is no heir to the throne. To retain your honor, you are expected to die in battle. Harn advises you as such.
#However, you refuse. You will not return to the Seat of Three Kings and attempt to rule, but neither will you commit what is essentially suicide against the Sidhe Elves. Instead, you send the rest of your army back to Marauderdom and go yourself further south, to the mouth of the Arendian river, where you live until your natural death.
