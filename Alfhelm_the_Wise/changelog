version ? (The FUTURE)
    - Pretty much everything
    ** resizing of maps (many are too big)
    ** redoing dialogue
    ** standardising difficulties
    ** fixing outdated/overly complex wml
    ** Move from the old gold format to the new one
    ** S8 fires aren't firing correctly
    ** S9 is fantastically unclear.
    ** S10 needs map updated to match S4 FoS
    ** S11 Bears are way too hard, scen. should have more units and no gold bonus
    ** S12 Ranhilde should be leader, and not able to recall. Frisyr should be able to recall and recruit Issalfr. Fight prestarted ala FoS?
    ** Sighted events seem weird all over...
    ** S12t, make Alfhelm go to ranhilde instead. Make Harn and troops leave due to crusade v Vaniyera.
    ** S13, just dueling Vaniyera sjould break sword, make this scen more epic.
    ** Gali taking Alfhelm's gold should work on some kind of formula.
