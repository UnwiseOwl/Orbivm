        #What I'm trying to do here is portray Vaniyera as a curious elf who is actually interested in people at first, but knows and regrets that it's his duty to fight them. Later on, and in later campaigns, he barely spares non-elves a positive thought, but here we see where this attitude first comes from and why it grows.

Whereas the Marauders are almost as at home as any elf amongst the trees, these Lavinians were out of place here in forests of the north, so different to the plains of their homelands in the far south."

At first, I admired their courage, spending a part of their brief lives travelling so far from their homeland seeking fame and glory. But they were here seeking the destruction of the Sidhe, so I knew that I must use my new knowledge to fight and destroy them in turn."
