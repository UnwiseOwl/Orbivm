They also excelled at bribery and espionage, and sometimes were known to evade defeat through the judicious application of these arts."

These Keltoi are proud to have no Dardanian or Lavinian blood flowing in their veins. (The Lavinian slur that Marauders are half-orcish is, of course, false.) They now use iron weapons, mainly axes and such, learned from the Lavinians and the newly arrived Elves. Also, now that they have been driven north by the Lavinians, they are forced to spend much more energy on mere survival, making the mundane positions of fisherman, hunter, and woodcutter much more important."

However, upon their encounter and subsequent battles with the Keltoi/Marauders, they fractured. The Issaelfr, who had taken up residence in Alfheim, wanted peace, but the Sidhe would accept no such thing. The matter was not helped when Vanimaro was slain in combat by the Marauders. Afterwards, the Sidhe dwelt in the eastern forests, their capital at Mt. Stormkeep. They were extremely xenophobic, and detested, above all, mankind, which they saw as a race of weaklings and traitors."

Quick is the most noticeable trait, particularly in slower moving units such as trolls or heavy infantry. Units with the quick trait often have greatly increased mobility in rough terrain, which can be important to consider when deploying your forces. Also, quick units aren’t quite as tough as units without this trait and are subsequently less good at holding contested positions."
