    description= _ "A flail is a much more effective weapon than a mace, however it is also heavier, more clumsy, and harder to use, so only the best and strongest fighters use them. These fighters are also the only ones given full body armour, because their flails are so clumsy, and they are so stong by now anyway, that the reduced mobility and extra weight doesn't matter."
