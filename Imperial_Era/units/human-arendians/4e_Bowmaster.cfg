This means that a Bowmaster can, at any one time, have thousands of men at his disposal something which the crown has been all too aware of ever since the great upriseing. when the bowmaster rose up because taxes were so intollerably high, men charged with killing the bandits often joined with them and carried out systematic raids on any rich settlments."
