    description= _ "A Nemidian Champion is one of the most skilled horseman ever, both in the Empire and in his homeland of Nemidia. His spear-charges are feared throughout the land, as are his scimitar and javelins. He has garbed himself in the Lavinian fashion, and even takes the red and golden colors of the Legion. If it were not for the fact that his skin was black - burnt by the sun, the Lavinians believe - he could be mistaken for a Lavinian general, commanding his Legionnaires from horseback."
