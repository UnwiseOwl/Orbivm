#EPILOGUE: This is not a Sword (952 SI, June)
#The remainder of the journey back to Dverkenn Tarn was uneventful... I believe my fighting days are over. The five months from my meeting with Alfhelm to my return to the Tarn were the most intense of my life, and I feel older than my century and a half.
#
#I expected to soon be called before the Masters of the IE_Cavernei_to account for my actions. Ond knows I have much to answer for. One day in June, the summons finally arrived. Trondar and I went to the Hall and stood before the Four Masters.
#
#We were mildly reprimanded for the slaying of Lokka and Volur, Syren dra'Friysn and the Thunderblade Faolan, but these deaths were not the reason the Masters wanted to speak with me. They wished to hear about Stormbreaker, and how it managed to destroy the thunderblades.
#
#I explained the mechanism to them, and witnessed the beginning of chaos. Midur, the Master of Sentinels, embraced what I called a 'clockwork sword' as a brilliant creation; Gand, the Master of Runesmiths, echoed Volur in decrying it as an abomination. The Four broke out in heated argument, and I was dismissed before I could see the resolution, neither punished nor rewarded.
