#SCENARIO 6: Promises to Keep (952 SI, February)
#Soon Alfhelm would confront Vaniyera, and would have need of his purchase. How soon? Trondar made some calculations... it was almost March. If Friysr had indeed sent aid to Alfhelm - where else would he have been, for his daughter to be in charge of his manor? - they could have left Portum Frigae, where Alfhelm had wintered, near the beginning of February. They would have been in Sidhe lands a week ago, and would be fighting Vaniyera already. We were almost too late; even if Alfhelm was not yet dead, there was no time to spare.
#
#But how were we to get from Alfenheim to the forests of the Sidhe in but a few days? Though Lokka and Volur had been slain, the Alfenheim Tunnels were closed to us, and there were no other lodestones in the vicinity. We could not port there.
#
#Well, there was one way. The lodestones were not the only way the hidden folk could move around quickly; we also had the great eagles. Even the River Ransal entrance had a pen with four or five of them. Trondar, a few chosen companions, and I myself saddled them and took off.
#
#Though the winds over Iceswept Bay slowed us down, we reached the forests of the Sidhe in less than a week. We were none too soon.
