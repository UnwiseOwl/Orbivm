#PROLOGUE (951 SI, November)
#When the sword of the elven king Vanimaro was shattered under his fallen body, the dwarves who witnessed it saw that the blade had, inexplicably, been of dwarven craftsmanship. It was these dwarves who offered to forge the twelve Thunderblades from its shards. These blades, forged by our greatest craftsmen and infused with our most powerful magics, were given to the elves at almost no cost. The elves, after all, were recent arrivals in these lands. The swords were a welcoming gift - and what a gift!
#
#Now, I was born eight hundred years after the arrival of the elves. When I was a century and a half old, I - already a Runemaster - was appointed steward of the Dverkenn Tarn well. While no Watcher myself, I directed their operations in that region, and whenever it was necessary for a dwarf to speak to a surface-dweller, I would be that dwarf.
#
#The wells may seem purposeless - why not simply make ourselves available to all who would speak with us? - but in truth, they are quite necessary. Some dwarves live on the surface, but even they have wells, for their homes are in remote mountains, and traders of other races could never make the journey regularly. So we build wells in places convenient for the surface-dwellers - though not too convenient - through which they can signal a desire to speak with us. If we judge them worth speaking to, we make the journey from our cities to the location of the well.
#
#In any case, it was my 150th year when a most unusual man dropped a scroll into the Dverkenn well. It was Alfhelm Alfricsson, called by some the Wise, the lord of the Marauders, returning from Lavinium in triumph. Our spies had reported all of this to me. I knew also of his wife Ranhilde, and her hopeless battle against the Sidhe. It is not often that royalty converse with the dwarves; we deal much more with merchants and the like. I was curious, then - curious indeed - to see what Alfhelm could possibly wish to speak with us about.
#
#As it turned out, he had just then heard of his wife's struggles, and he purposed to do something about it. The Sidhe lord behind his sorrows was named Vaniyera - a Thunderblade. Alfhelm wished to kill this elf. To slay a Thunderblade meant either treachery, or beating the elf in swordplay - something my ancestors had ensured was impossible. Alfhelm was no traitor, and so he needed something unimaginable - a sword that could defeat a thunderblade.
#
#Alfhelm could pay us well. I agreed to create for him such a sword, to be delivered before he fought his nemesis, in exchange for the bulk of the treasure he had carried out of Lavinium. It was almost amusing; much of what he gave us had come originally from our own treasuries, in exchange for Lavinian grain.
#
#When a steward receives a contract from a surface-dweller, he normally relays it to the council and they decide who fulfills it, but this is not, strictly speaking, mandatory. I decided to forge this sword myself. It would prove my worth as a smith. This sword was to be my masterpiece.

#SCENARIO 1: KINGS AND BEGGARS (951 SI, November)
#So, I began to think about how to make such a sword. I had a few ideas, but nothing definite... I would need more time, more time.
#
#A few days after Alfhelm spoke to me, we were visited by a dwarf named Lokka. He was the lord of the northern IE_Cavernei_, those who interacted with the Issaelfr and, occasionally, the Marauders. He was also the great-great-grandson of the dwarf who forged the Thunderblades. He was returning home from the deep south, where he had went to see the wreckage of Lavinium for himself.
#
#When he asked what project I was working on at the time, I told him of my contract with Alfhelm. This greatly agitated him, and he insisted that a project of such significance had to be approved by the Masters before I could begin. I told him that he could go report it if he wanted to, but I was going to start working on it. He then demanded the use of the lodestone - a great expense, transporting menn, which we try to avoid as much as possible, but he insisted, and he did outrank me - and departed in a great hurry.
#
#The next day, the sentry at the gate reported a group of men coming towards the well. When they reached the well, however, they did not stop there - they continued towards the tarn, searching out our hiding place. What is more, they found it. This band of outlaws attacked our sentry and tried to force its way into the tunnels.
#
#They were, with some difficulty, repulsed. One of them almost disturbed the lodestone - that would have been a calamity indeed - but he was stopped in time. When we finally fought our way back to the entrance and surrounded the leader of these men, he refused to tell us how he found the place, saying only that he had been told that there was a cave somewhere in the area, guarded by dwarves, with gold and a valuable iron rock.
