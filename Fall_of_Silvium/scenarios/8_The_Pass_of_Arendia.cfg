#BONUS SCENARIO: The Pass of Arendia (892 SI, January)
#
#The Emperor was not pleased with your flight from Silvia. You are, for a time, removed from the
#Legion. However, the war with the Marauders proves long, and costly. The Empire has need of
#experienced commanders to take the place of those who have fallen. You are sent to the new front,
#the border between Arendia and the former province of Silvia. There you will repulse the Marauders
# - or die.
#
#This scenario is unwinnable, any you don't need to play it to have been considered to "win the
#campaign". Basically, there is a Marauder leader, and you get to recall your advanced units from
#the campaign but cannot recruit new ones; however, your gold should be a set amount, say, 400,
#instead of being carried over from previous scenarios. You can defeat the Marauder leader, but
#if you do, it just goes back to the same scenario, with the Marauder getting more and more gold,
#until eventually, you are defeated. It seems to me like a fun way to actually use all of the
#excess advanced units you accumulate over the course of the campaign.
