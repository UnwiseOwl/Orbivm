#SCENARIO 6t: Mount Stormkeep (891 SI, April)
#
#This Sidhe lord has accepted your plea for help, and brings  you to the Sidhe court at Mount
#Stormkeep. There, you convince the Wild Elven Council that you are running away from the marauders,
#their enemies, and you are not invading them. There is a council of Sidhe elders; most believe you,
#but a minority does not. The lord who first agreed to help you argues your case, and another lord
#is strongly against helping you. There are 6 members of the council total, along with twelve
# advisory thunderblades (of which Leithan is one).
#
#This is a talking scenario.
#
#THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL:
#STORMLORDS:
#Saoir, Samhna, Onnachadh, Dayire, Longsygh, Maol.
#
#THUNDERBLADES:
#Western March:
#	??? - northern quadrant
#	??? - eastern quadrant
#	Leithan - western quadrant
#	Faolan - southern quadrant
#
#Northern March:
#
#Southern March:
#
#Faelyndun, Suileabin, Uidhir, Iarla, Dubhain,
#Ceallayach, Oisan, Daithi, Cadhla, Cylluinn.
