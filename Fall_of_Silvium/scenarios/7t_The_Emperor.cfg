#SCENARIO 7t: The Emperor (891 SI, August)
#
#You come back to Lavinium, the capital city of the Empire, in disgrace. Unintentionally, you have
#sparked a war between the Lavinian Empire and the Marauders, and have turned the Sidhe completely
#against you. The stage is set for the final battle between the Marauders and the Lavinians. You are
#brought before the Emperor to account for your actions.
